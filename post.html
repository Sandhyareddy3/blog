          De finibus bonorum et malorum ("On the ends of good and evil") is a Socratic dialogue by the Roman orator, 
          politician, and Academic Skeptic philosopher Marcus Tullius Cicero. It consists of three dialogues, over five books, 
          in which Cicero discusses the philosophical views of Epicureanism, Stoicism, and the Platonism of Antiochus of
           Ascalon (whose hybrid system mingled Stoicism with an "Old Academy" tradition of Platonism and Aristotelianism).
            The treatise is structured so that each philosophical system is described in its own book and then disputed in the
             following book (with exception of Antiochus' view which is both explained and disputed in book five). The book
              was developed in the summer of the year 45 BC, and was written over the course of about one and a half months.
               Together with the Tusculanae Quaestiones written shortly afterwards and the Academica, De finibus bonorum et
                malorum is one of the most extensive philosophical works of Cicero.

        <p>
          The first two books are a dialogue set at Cicero's country home in Cumae between himself and a young Epicurean named
           Lucius Torquatus, while another young Roman named Gaius Triarius listens on. In the first book, the interlocutors present
            the Epicurean theory of hedonism, which holds that pleasure in the form of aponia (absence of pain) is regarded as the
             highest good. In the second book, Cicero criticizes this view, attacking the Epicurean definition of pleasure and 
             arguing that it is inconsistent to hold pleasure as the absence of pain as the final good, since these are not one single good, but rather two distinct goods.

        <h2>Section 1.1</h2>
        <p>
         In the next two books Stoic ethics are discussed. In the third book Cicero's interlocutor, Marcus Porcius 
         Cato, presents Stoic doctrine. Here Cicero introduces the technical terms used by the Stoics into Latin. The 
         highest and only good of the Stoics is virtue (moral good). In the fourth book, Cicero casts doubt on this dogma,
         arguing a supposed natural state (the "cradle argument"), as well as issues regarding the exclusion of other
         goods entailed by Stoic doctrine.
        </p>
        <h2>Section 1.2</h2>
        <p>
          In the last book Cicero presents in the form of a dialogue between himself and several friends the theory of
           eudaimonia taught by Antiochus of Ascalon, which treats Aristotelianism as a subgroup of Platonism. This theory
           includes both virtue and external goods as the highest good. At the end of the book, Cicero criticized logical
           inconsistencies of this teaching, but more briefly and only addressing details, not broader principles. Cicero
           then declares that he follows this school of thought, albeit not without reservations, while respecting the valuable 
           aspects of the teachings presented in the previous books.
